Upon navigation to the url the user will see blog posts made by all users and comments on those post. They will have the options to sign up or log in on the navigation bar. If the user tries to navigate to the dashboard they will be prompted to log in. Once the user is logged in they will have the option to leave a comment on any blog post from the home page and they will be able to view their dashboard. On their dash board they will see all the posts they have made along with a button to create a new post. The user has the ability to update or delete their posts form the dashboard by clicking anywhere on their post the edit and delete buttons will appear. Once the user is logged in they will no longer have the log in or sign up navigation options, in their place will be a log out button. Once the user clicks the log out button they will be logged out and their session ended.
